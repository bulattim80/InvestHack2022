# Project Name & Pitch 
Trech
Trech is a web application for interaction between a broker and a user built with React, JavaScript, and CSS.

# Project Status

This project is currently under development. Users can exchange messages by username, exchange media files. Functionality for displaying widgets is under development

# Reflection
This web application was written as part of the InvestHack2022 hackathon, which took 3 days.
It needed to be implemented in React, but our problem was that none of the team had worked with it before. Therefore, we studied a new framework for us in the shortest possible time.
